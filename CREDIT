## Sprites
 
The project uses a sprite called `human_regular_hair.png` for the main character animation. It is supposed to be a placeholder until I can decide what to do with it. I can't remember where I downloaded it from, but I will look for it again. It was a free spritesheet. It may have come from `itch.io` but I can't be sure right now.
